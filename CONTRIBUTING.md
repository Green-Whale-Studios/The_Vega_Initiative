# Contributing Guidelines
We keep all bugs and feature requests listed in Issues.
Please, therefore, only work on tasks listed there.

To contribute, fork the repository and send your commits there, then send a contributing pull request into the dev branch when you are completed.
After that, your change will be reviewed and checked, then approved, or changes will be requested - if this occurs, please rectify the issues as soon as possible, in order for your pull request to be merged sooner.

## Push Access
We do not give anyone outside of our organisation (@Green-Whale-Studios) push access to the repo, so do not request it.
If a member of our team knows you IRL or you push several high-quality pull requests, we will consider adding you to our organisation.

## Suggestions and Bugs
Please report all bugs and feature requests in an issue with the appropriate tags.
If you are working on an issue, please comment saying so, so that we are aware.

All issues will be reviewed and divided among our dev team, so if you wish to work on an issue, please ping the Vega Initiative dev team in a comment on said issue, and let us know your estimated timeframe for your changes to be completed - if this timeframe is acceptable we will let you know and will ask for updates regularly. Note that failure to provide updates can result in your pull request being ignored in favour of changes made already by our team.
